# Us-Home-Prices-Prediction

The goal of the model is to build a Data Science model for predicting US Home Prices in the Future. I have selected some key supply demand factors from the internet that may have influenced the prices over the past 20 years.

These factors after required preprocessing were merged into one dataset except the Home Price Index which was taken as a proxy for home prices. The data was taken from 1st Jan 2001 to 31st Dec 2020. I split the data into training(80%) and test(20%). The models were selected on the basis of RMSE score and Random Forest Model was seen as the best performing model.
